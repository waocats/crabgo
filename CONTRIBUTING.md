## Before hacking on Crabgo

We encourage people to discuss their design before hacking on code. Typically,
you [file an issue] or start a thread on the [internals forum] before submitting
a pull request. Please read [the process] of how features and bugs are managed
in Crabgo.

**NOTICE: Due to limited review capacity, the Crabgo team is not accepting new
features or major changes at this time. Please consult with the team before
opening a new PR. Only issues that have been explicitly marked as accepted
will be reviewed.**
