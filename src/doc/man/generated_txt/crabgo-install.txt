CRABGO-INSTALL(1)

NAME
       crabgo-install — Build and install a Rust binary

SYNOPSIS
       crabgo install [options] crate[@version]…
       crabgo install [options] --path path
       crabgo install [options] --git url [crate…]
       crabgo install [options] --list

DESCRIPTION
       This command manages Crabgo’s local set of installed binary crates.
       Only packages which have executable [[bin]] or [[example]] targets can
       be installed, and all executables are installed into the installation
       root’s bin folder.

       The installation root is determined, in order of precedence:

       o  --root option

       o  CRABGO_INSTALL_ROOT environment variable

       o  install.root Crabgo config value
          <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>

       o  CRABGO_HOME environment variable

       o  $HOME/.crabgo

       There are multiple sources from which a crate can be installed. The
       default location is crates.io but the --git, --path, and --registry
       flags can change this source. If the source contains more than one
       package (such as crates.io or a git repository with multiple crates) the
       crate argument is required to indicate which crate should be installed.

       Crates from crates.io can optionally specify the version they wish to
       install via the --version flags, and similarly packages from git
       repositories can optionally specify the branch, tag, or revision that
       should be installed. If a crate has multiple binaries, the --bin
       argument can selectively install only one of them, and if you’d rather
       install examples the --example argument can be used as well.

       If the package is already installed, Crabgo will reinstall it if the
       installed version does not appear to be up-to-date. If any of the
       following values change, then Crabgo will reinstall the package:

       o  The package version and source.

       o  The set of binary names installed.

       o  The chosen features.

       o  The profile (--profile).

       o  The target (--target).

       Installing with --path will always build and install, unless there are
       conflicting binaries from another package. The --force flag may be used
       to force Crabgo to always reinstall the package.

       If the source is crates.io or --git then by default the crate will be
       built in a temporary target directory. To avoid this, the target
       directory can be specified by setting the CRABGO_TARGET_DIR environment
       variable to a relative path. In particular, this can be useful for
       caching build artifacts on continuous integration systems.

   Dealing with the Lockfile
       By default, the Crabgo.lock file that is included with the package will
       be ignored. This means that Crabgo will recompute which versions of
       dependencies to use, possibly using newer versions that have been
       released since the package was published. The --locked flag can be used
       to force Crabgo to use the packaged Crabgo.lock file if it is available.
       This may be useful for ensuring reproducible builds, to use the exact
       same set of dependencies that were available when the package was
       published. It may also be useful if a newer version of a dependency is
       published that no longer builds on your system, or has other problems.
       The downside to using --locked is that you will not receive any fixes or
       updates to any dependency. Note that Crabgo did not start publishing
       Crabgo.lock files until version 1.37, which means packages published with
       prior versions will not have a Crabgo.lock file available.

   Configuration Discovery
       This command operates on system or user level, not project level. This
       means that the local configuration discovery
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure>
       is ignored. Instead, the configuration discovery begins at
       $CRABGO_HOME/config.toml. If the package is installed with --path $PATH,
       the local configuration will be used, beginning discovery at
       $PATH/.crabgo/config.toml.

OPTIONS
   Install Options
       --vers version, --version version
           Specify a version to install. This may be a version requirement
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/specifying-dependencies.md>,
           like ~1.2, to have Crabgo select the newest version from the given
           requirement. If the version does not have a requirement operator
           (such as ^ or ~), then it must be in the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, and
           will install exactly that version; it is not treated as a caret
           requirement like Crabgo dependencies are.

       --git url
           Git URL to install the specified crate from.

       --branch branch
           Branch to use when installing from git.

       --tag tag
           Tag to use when installing from git.

       --rev sha
           Specific commit to use when installing from git.

       --path path
           Filesystem path to local crate to install.

       --list
           List all installed packages and their versions.

       -f, --force
           Force overwriting existing crates or binaries. This can be used if a
           package has installed a binary with the same name as another
           package. This is also useful if something has changed on the system
           that you want to rebuild with, such as a newer version of rustc.

       --no-track
           By default, Crabgo keeps track of the installed packages with a
           metadata file stored in the installation root directory. This flag
           tells Crabgo not to use or create that file. With this flag, Crabgo
           will refuse to overwrite any existing files unless the --force flag
           is used. This also disables Crabgo’s ability to protect against
           multiple concurrent invocations of Crabgo installing at the same
           time.

       --bin name…
           Install only the specified binary.

       --bins
           Install all binaries.

       --example name…
           Install only the specified example.

       --examples
           Install all examples.

       --root dir
           Directory to install packages into.

       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in Crabgo
           config files
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, the default registry is used, which is defined by the
           registry.default config key which defaults to crates-io.

       --index index
           The URL of the registry index to use.

   Feature Selection
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When
       no feature options are given, the default feature is activated for every
       selected package.

       See the features documentation
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options>
       for more details.

       -F features, --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of
           workspace members may be enabled with package-name/feature-name
           syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       --all-features
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       --no-default-features
           Do not activate the default feature of the selected packages.

   Compilation Options
       --target triple
           Install for the given architecture. The default is the host
           architecture. The general format of the triple is
           <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>. Run rustc --print target-list for
           a list of supported targets.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Crabgo run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/guide/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

       --target-dir directory
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May
           also be specified with the CRABGO_TARGET_DIR environment variable, or
           the build.target-dir config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           a new temporary folder located in the temporary directory of the
           platform.

           When using --path, by default it will use target directory in the
           workspace of the local crate unless --target-dir is specified.

       --debug
           Build with the dev profile instead of the release profile. See also
           the --profile option for choosing a specific profile by name.

       --profile name
           Install with the given profile. See the the reference
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/profiles.html> for more
           details on profiles.

       --ignore-rust-version
           Install the target even if the selected Rust compiler is older than
           the required Rust version as configured in the project’s
           rust-version field.

       --timings=fmts
           Output information how long each compilation takes, and track
           concurrency information over time. Accepts an optional
           comma-separated list of output formats; --timings without an
           argument will default to --timings=html. Specifying an output format
           (rather than the default) is unstable and requires
           -Zunstable-options. Valid output formats:

           o  html (unstable, requires -Zunstable-options): Write a
              human-readable file crabgo-timing.html to the target/crabgo-timings
              directory with a report of the compilation. Also write a report
              to the same directory with a timestamp in the filename if you
              want to look at older runs. HTML output is suitable for human
              consumption only, and does not provide machine-readable timing
              data.

           o  json (unstable, requires -Zunstable-options): Emit
              machine-readable JSON information about timing information.

   Manifest Options
       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Crabgo.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Crabgo will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Crabgo
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Crabgo.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Crabgo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Crabgo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Crabgo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Crabgo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the crabgo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

   Miscellaneous Options
       -j N, --jobs N
           Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
           build.jobs config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           the number of logical CPUs. If negative, it sets the maximum number
           of parallel jobs to the number of logical CPUs plus provided value.
           Should not be 0.

       --keep-going
           Build as many crates in the dependency graph as possible, rather
           than aborting the build on the first one that fails to build.
           Unstable, requires -Zunstable-options.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print crabgo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

       --message-format fmt
           The output format for diagnostic messages. Can be specified multiple
           times and consists of comma-separated values. Valid values:

           o  human (default): Display in a human-readable text format.
              Conflicts with short and json.

           o  short: Emit shorter, human-readable text messages. Conflicts with
              human and json.

           o  json: Emit JSON messages to stdout. See the reference
              <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/external-tools.html#json-messages>
              for more details. Conflicts with human and short.

           o  json-diagnostic-short: Ensure the rendered field of JSON messages
              contains the “short” rendering from rustc. Cannot be used
              with human or short.

           o  json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi: Ensure the rendered field of JSON
              messages contains embedded ANSI color codes for respecting
              rustc’s default color scheme. Cannot be used with human or
              short.

           o  json-render-diagnostics: Instruct Crabgo to not include rustc
              diagnostics in JSON messages printed, but instead Crabgo itself
              should render the JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Crabgo’s
              own JSON diagnostics and others coming from rustc are still
              emitted. Cannot be used with human or short.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Crabgo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           crabgo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Crabgo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where crabgo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Crabgo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .crabgo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example crabgo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/crabgo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Crabgo. Run crabgo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Crabgo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Crabgo succeeded.

       o  101: Crabgo failed to complete.
