CRABGO-YANK(1)

NAME
       crabgo-yank — Remove a pushed crate from the index

SYNOPSIS
       crabgo yank [options] crate@version
       crabgo yank [options] --version version [crate]

DESCRIPTION
       The yank command removes a previously published crate’s version from
       the server’s index. This command does not delete any data, and the
       crate will still be available for download via the registry’s download
       link.

       Crabgo will not use a yanked version for any new project or checkout
       without a pre-existing lockfile, and will generate an error if there are
       no longer any compatible versions for your crate.

       This command requires you to be authenticated with either the --token
       option or using crabgo-login(1).

       If the crate name is not specified, it will use the package name from
       the current directory.

   How yank works
       For example, the foo crate published version 1.5.0 and another crate bar
       declared a dependency on version foo = "1.5". Now foo releases a new,
       but not semver compatible, version 2.0.0, and finds a critical issue
       with 1.5.0. If 1.5.0 is yanked, no new project or checkout without an
       existing lockfile will be able to use crate bar as it relies on 1.5.

       In this case, the maintainers of foo should first publish a semver
       compatible version such as 1.5.1 prior to yanking 1.5.0 so that bar and
       all projects that depend on bar will continue to work.

       As another example, consider a crate bar with published versions 1.5.0,
       1.5.1, 1.5.2, 2.0.0 and 3.0.0. The following table identifies the
       versions crabgo could use in the absence of a lockfile for different
       SemVer requirements, following a given release being yanked:

       +------------------------+----------------------+----------+----------+
       | Yanked Version /       | bar = "1.5.0"        | bar =    | bar =    |
       | SemVer requirement     |                      | "=1.5.0" | "2.0.0"  |
       +------------------------+----------------------+----------+----------+
       | 1.5.0                  | Use either 1.5.1 or  | Return   | Use      |
       |                        | 1.5.2                | Error    | 2.0.0    |
       +------------------------+----------------------+----------+----------+
       | 1.5.1                  | Use either 1.5.0 or  | Use      | Use      |
       |                        | 1.5.2                | 1.5.0    | 2.0.0    |
       +------------------------+----------------------+----------+----------+
       | 2.0.0                  | Use either 1.5.0,    | Use      | Return   |
       |                        | 1.5.1 or 0.22.2      | 1.5.0    | Error    |
       +------------------------+----------------------+----------+----------+

   When to yank
       Crates should only be yanked in exceptional circumstances, for example,
       an accidental publish, an unintentional SemVer breakages, or a
       significantly broken and unusable crate. In the case of security
       vulnerabilities, RustSec <https://rustsec.org/> is typically a less
       disruptive mechanism to inform users and encourage them to upgrade, and
       avoids the possibility of significant downstream disruption irrespective
       of susceptibility to the vulnerability in question.

       A common workflow is to yank a crate having already published a semver
       compatible version, to reduce the probability of preventing dependent
       crates from compiling.

       When addressing copyright, licensing, or personal data issues with a
       published crate, simply yanking it may not suffice. In such cases,
       contact the maintainers of the registry you used. For crates.io, refer
       to their policies <https://crates.io/policies> and contact them at
       <help@crates.io>.

       If credentials have been leaked, the recommended course of action is to
       revoke them immediately. Once a crate has been published, it is
       impossible to determine if the leaked credentials have been copied.
       Yanking the crate only prevents new users from downloading it, but
       cannot stop those who have already downloaded it from keeping or even
       spreading the leaked credentials.

OPTIONS
   Yank Options
       --vers version, --version version
           The version to yank or un-yank.

       --undo
           Undo a yank, putting a version back into the index.

       --token token
           API token to use when authenticating. This overrides the token
           stored in the credentials file (which is created by crabgo-login(1)).

           Crabgo config <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>
           environment variables can be used to override the tokens stored in
           the credentials file. The token for crates.io may be specified with
           the CRABGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN environment variable. Tokens for other
           registries may be specified with environment variables of the form
           CRABGO_REGISTRIES_NAME_TOKEN where NAME is the name of the registry
           in all capital letters.

       --index index
           The URL of the registry index to use.

       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in Crabgo
           config files
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, the default registry is used, which is defined by the
           registry.default config key which defaults to crates-io.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print crabgo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Crabgo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           crabgo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Crabgo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where crabgo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Crabgo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .crabgo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example crabgo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/crabgo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Crabgo. Run crabgo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Crabgo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Crabgo succeeded.

       o  101: Crabgo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Yank a crate from the index:

              crabgo yank foo@1.0.7
