CRABGO-FETCH(1)

NAME
       crabgo-fetch — Fetch dependencies of a package from the network

SYNOPSIS
       crabgo fetch [options]

DESCRIPTION
       If a Crabgo.lock file is available, this command will ensure that all of
       the git dependencies and/or registry dependencies are downloaded and
       locally available. Subsequent Crabgo commands will be able to run offline
       after a crabgo fetch unless the lock file changes.

       If the lock file is not available, then this command will generate the
       lock file before fetching the dependencies.

       If --target is not specified, then all target dependencies are fetched.

       See also the crabgo-prefetch <https://crates.io/crates/crabgo-prefetch>
       plugin which adds a command to download popular crates. This may be
       useful if you plan to use Crabgo without a network with the --offline
       flag.

OPTIONS
   Fetch options
       --target triple
           Fetch for the given architecture. The default is all architectures.
           The general format of the triple is
           <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>. Run rustc --print target-list for
           a list of supported targets. This flag may be specified multiple
           times.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Crabgo run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/guide/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print crabgo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Crabgo.toml file. By default, Crabgo searches for the
           Crabgo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Crabgo.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Crabgo will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Crabgo
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Crabgo.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Crabgo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Crabgo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Crabgo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Crabgo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the crabgo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Crabgo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           crabgo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Crabgo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where crabgo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Crabgo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .crabgo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example crabgo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/crabgo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Crabgo. Run crabgo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Crabgo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Crabgo succeeded.

       o  101: Crabgo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Fetch all dependencies:
