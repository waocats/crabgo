CRABGO-VENDOR(1)

NAME
       crabgo-vendor — Vendor all dependencies locally

SYNOPSIS
       crabgo vendor [options] [path]

DESCRIPTION
       This crabgo subcommand will vendor all crates.io and git dependencies for
       a project into the specified directory at <path>. After this command
       completes the vendor directory specified by <path> will contain all
       remote sources from dependencies specified. Additional manifests beyond
       the default one can be specified with the -s option.

       The crabgo vendor command will also print out the configuration necessary
       to use the vendored sources, which you will need to add to
       .crabgo/config.toml.

OPTIONS
   Vendor Options
       -s manifest, --sync manifest
           Specify an extra Crabgo.toml manifest to workspaces which should also
           be vendored and synced to the output. May be specified multiple
           times.

       --no-delete
           Don’t delete the “vendor” directory when vendoring, but rather
           keep all existing contents of the vendor directory

       --respect-source-config
           Instead of ignoring [source] configuration by default in
           .crabgo/config.toml read it and use it when downloading crates from
           crates.io, for example

       --versioned-dirs
           Normally versions are only added to disambiguate multiple versions
           of the same package. This option causes all directories in the
           “vendor” directory to be versioned, which makes it easier to
           track the history of vendored packages over time, and can help with
           the performance of re-vendoring when only a subset of the packages
           have changed.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Crabgo.toml file. By default, Crabgo searches for the
           Crabgo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Crabgo.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Crabgo will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Crabgo
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Crabgo.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Crabgo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Crabgo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Crabgo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Crabgo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the crabgo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print crabgo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Crabgo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           crabgo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Crabgo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where crabgo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Crabgo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .crabgo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example crabgo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/crabgo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Crabgo. Run crabgo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/crabgo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Crabgo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Crabgo succeeded.

       o  101: Crabgo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Vendor all dependencies into a local “vendor” folder

              crabgo vendor

       2. Vendor all dependencies into a local “third-party/vendor” folder

              crabgo vendor third-party/vendor

       3. Vendor the current workspace as well as another to “vendor”

              crabgo vendor -s ../path/to/Crabgo.toml
